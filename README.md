## 🚀 Installation & Usage Guide

Make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (version 16 or higher is recommended) and [Git](https://git-scm.com/) installed.

1.  **Clone This Repository**
    Open your terminal or command prompt and run the following command:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/SCxVBS/Craft-World-Auto-Bot.git
    ```

2.  **Navigate to the Project Directory**
    ```bash
    cd Craft-World-Auto-Bot
    ```

3.  **Install Dependencies**
    Run this command to install all the necessary packages for the bot.
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

4.  **Create Private Key File**
    Create a new file named `pk.txt` in the project folder, then fill it with your wallet's *private key*.

5.  **Configure Your Assets**
    - Open the `config.json` file.
    - Modify its content according to the `mineIds`, `factoryIds`, and `areaIds` you own.
    
    **Example `config.json`:**
    ```json
    {
      "name": "My Craft World Account",
      "mineIds": [
        "mine-id-1",
        "mine-id-2"
      ],
      "factoryIds": [
        "factory-id-1",
        "factory-id-2",
        "factory-id-3"
      ],
      "areaIds": [
        "area-id-1"
      ]
    }
    ```

6.  **How to Find Your Asset IDs**
    To get the IDs, you need to use the *Developer Tools* feature in your browser.
    -   Open the Craft World website in your browser (Chrome/Firefox).
    -   Right-click anywhere on the page, then select **"Inspect"** or press the **F12** key.
    -   Select the **"Network"** tab.
    -   Perform an action in the game (e.g., start a mine). A request named `ingest` will appear. Click on that request.
    -   In the panel that appears, look for the **"Payload"** or **"Request"** tab. You will find the required ID there.

    **A. Finding `mineId`**
    Perform an action related to a mine (start/claim) to find the `mineId`.

    **B. Finding `factoryId`**
    Perform an action related to a factory (start) to find the `factoryId`.

    **C. Finding `areaId`**
    Perform an action related to an area (claim) to find the `areaId`.

7.  **Run the Bot**
    After all configurations are complete, run the bot with the command:
    ```bash
    node index.js
    ```
    The bot will start running, and you will see the activity logs in your terminal.
